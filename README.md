#Problem: 
Morgan State University has recently bought the Save A Lot grocery store property area. The issue is that they never replaced the grocery store nor are offering an alternative network for residents of the area to gain access to healthy foods at the cost of Save A Lot prices in our immediate area.  This was the closest walking distance grocery store for the community residents of not only for the multiple communities of Morganites in the area. Now our current options for immediate food is Sunny's Chicken & Wings, 7/11, Mc Donalds, the community Liquor store, and Rite Aid. 

#Solution:
An open source free car pooling solution to address the needs of this community to travel to and from the grocery store. As a community we build the app solution for us.
